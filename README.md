Start up the Mongo Database

cd ~/mongo/bin
./mongod --dbpath ~/mongo-data

Now the mongo database is up on port 27017

You can open up Robomongo and it will prompt you to connect to localhost:27017 for you to play around with it there.


Start up the Node/Express server

node server/server.js

You'll get a message that the server is up on port 3000.

And you're good to start making requests!
